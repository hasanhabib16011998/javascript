**four main theoretical pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **JavaScript**:

---

### 1. **Encapsulation**

* Encapsulation is the concept of **bundling data and the methods that operate on that data** into a single unit (usually an object).
* It **hides the internal state** of an object and only exposes a controlled interface to the outside world.
* This protects the data from unintended or harmful changes and improves modularity.

---

### 2. **Abstraction**

* Abstraction means **hiding complex implementation details** and showing only the necessary features of an object.
* It allows developers to work with **simplified interfaces** and reduces complexity.
* Abstraction helps in focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.

---

### 3. **Inheritance**

* Inheritance is the mechanism by which **one class (child/subclass) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass)**.
* It promotes **code reuse** and establishes a **hierarchical relationship** between classes.
* Child classes can also **override** or **extend** the functionality of parent classes.

---

### 4. **Polymorphism**

* Polymorphism allows **objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass**.
* It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
* This allows for **method overriding** and the ability to **interchangeably use different objects** that share the same method name or interface.

These pillars form the foundation of OOP and help in designing clean, scalable, and maintainable software systems.
